/**
 * @brief Library for asynchronous Particle.publish on the Particle Photon, Electron, and other devices.
 *
 * This library is designed for fire-and-forget publishing of events. It allows you to publish, even
 * when not connected to the cloud, and the events are saved until connected. It also buffers events
 * so you can call it a bunch of times rapidly and the events are metered out one per second to stay
 * within the publish limits.
 *
 * Also, it's entirely non-blocking. The publishing occurs from a separate thread so the loop is never
 * blocked.
 *
 * And it uses retained memory, so the events are saved you reboot or go into sleep mode. They'll be
 * transmitted when you finally connect to the cloud again.
